## **Jinwen Wang**
 
|<br> He is a final year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). He is currently working in Computer Security and Privacy Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Ning Zhang](https://cybersecurity.seas.wustl.edu/ning/index.html). He earned his M.S. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University (THU) in 2019, where he was advised by [Prof. Qi Li](https://sites.google.com/site/qili2012/) in 2019, and his B.E. in Computer Science from Sichuan University (SCU) in 2016. <br><br>His research interests include **System Security**, **Software Security**, **Cyber-physical Systems (CPS)**, **Secure and Privacy-preserving ML System**. He focuses on securing cyber-physical systems and MLSys by designing and implementing efficient runtime security mechanisms, including attack isolation (TEE on CPU and GPU), prevention (CFI, DFI, privacy-preserving ML systems), and mitigation (recovery). He also develops scalable security reasoning approaches (remote attestation and fuzzing). His work spans various CPSs, including autonomous vehicles and medical devices, with diverse architectures like CPUs and GPUs.<br><br>  **Email:** <jinwen.wang@wustl.edu>  <br> <br> | <br> &emsp; ![image](../images/jinwen.jpg) <br> <br> |
