## **Jinwen Wang**


|<br> Dr. Jinwen Wang is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). His research focuses on **Cyber-Physical Systems Security** and **Machine Learning System Security**. Jinwen earned his PhD from Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) under the supervision of [Prof. Ning Zhang](https://cybersecurity.seas.wustl.edu/ning/index.html), and his master’s degree from Tsinghua University (THU) under [Prof. Qi Li](https://sites.google.com/site/qili2012/).<br><br>  **Email:** <jinwen.wang@utdallas.edu>  <br> <br> | <br> ![image](../images/jinwen.jpg) <br> <br> |



<!-- |<br> He is a final year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). He is currently working in Computer Security and Privacy Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Ning Zhang](https://cybersecurity.seas.wustl.edu/ning/index.html). He earned his M.S. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University (THU) in 2019, where he was advised by [Prof. Qi Li](https://sites.google.com/site/qili2012/) in 2019, and his B.E. in Computer Science from Sichuan University (SCU) in 2016. <br><br>His research interests include **System Security**, **Software Security**, **Cyber-physical Systems (CPS)**, **Real-time Systems**,  **Privacy-preserving ML System**. He focuses on securing cyber-physical systems and MLSys by designing and implementing efficient (real-time performance guarenteed) runtime security mechanisms, including attack isolation (TEE on CPU and GPU), prevention (CFI, DFI, privacy-preserving ML systems), and mitigation (recovery). He also develops scalable security reasoning approaches (remote attestation, fuzzing, and fingerprinting). His work spans various CPSs, including autonomous vehicles and medical devices, with diverse architectures like CPUs and GPUs.<br><br>  **Email:** <jinwen.wang@wustl.edu>  <br> <br> | <br> ![image](../images/jinwen.jpg) <br> <br> | -->
